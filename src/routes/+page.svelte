<h1>
    Hello, world!
</h1>
<p>
    I'm a Software Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer specialising in
    systems programming, compilers, and cloud-native applications. With
    extensive experience in performance optimisation and scalable architecture,
    I focus on building robust, efficient solutions to complex technical
    challenges.
</p><br>
<p>
    My primary expertise lies in C programming, with strong proficiency in Rust,
    Go, and C++. While these form the core of my technical toolkit, I maintain
    an open mindset towards other programming languages and technologies that
    best serve each project's unique requirements.
</p><br>
<p>
    As a systems programmer, I specialise in developing secure, scalable, and
    efficient infrastructure. My experience spans UNIX (and UNIX-like) systems,
    particularly FreeBSD, where I actively contribute to the community. I'm
    passionate about software and system architecture, performance optimisation,
    and building reliable and distributed systems.
