<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>
  I'm a software engineer working at the intersection of systems programming,
  compilers, and large-scale infrastructure — where software meets the metal.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  My work centres on the design and implementation of clean, performant, and
  enduring systems. From kernel internals to distributed services, I build
  software that balances precision with practicality, and simplicity with
  scalability.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  I write primarily in C, with strong proficiency in Rust, Go, and C++. My
  experience with operating systems spans UNIX-like systems — particularly
  FreeBSD, where I actively contribute to the community. I'm deeply interested
  in systems architecture, runtime tooling, and performance engineering —
  ensuring that the systems we build today remain observable, secure, and
  maintainable tomorrow.
</p>
